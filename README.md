# CIS 350 Command-Line Style Checker

The files in this repo should all be in the same folder on your local computer when running the style checker. You can run it via command line with the following command:
```
python3 style_check.py <your_hw_folder>
```
e.g.
```
python3 style_check.py ~/Code/cis350/hw1
```
Any style errors will be printed to the terminal window. You're free to run and re-run as many times as you'd like as you update your code and fix any found style errors.

This style checker was inspired by an Eclipse plugin created by CIS 121. Check it out here: https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis121/current/resources/guides/style-checker-setup.html
